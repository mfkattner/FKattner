# **Research Interests**

My research focuses on auditory perception, learning, and cognition. In particular, I am interested in how humans process sound that is irrelevant to the current goals, and how this depends on sensory and cognitive processing skills. In this regard, I am also studying the relation between specific sound properties (e.g., loudness, pitch or fluctuation strength) and psychological parameters such as subjective evaluations (e.g., liking, annoyance, or unpleasantness) and cognitive performance (e.g., speech intelligibility or working memory). To quantify the degree of irrelevant sound processing, I look specifically at the degree of disruption that is produced by the sound in a cognitive task, and I also study how learning affects these disruptions. In the field of learning, I am also interested more generally in the transfer of perceptual and associative learning to new tasks and stimuli, as well as in the relationship between evaluative conditioning and cognitive and perceptual processing. In addition to these learning studies, I am working on methodological questions in the field of psychophysical measurement.

## *Auditory Cognition*

Using the classical “irrelevant sound paradigm”, I am investigating the disruptive effects of background sound on cognitive performance, such as the memorization of verbal items. In particular, I am interested in the properties of sounds (e.g., phonological integrity) that interfere with specific processes during the retention of verbal information. In addition, I am interesting in the role of auditory selective attention, with some studies indicating that enhanced attentional resources may shield against auditory distraction. To study the relationship between auditory processing and attention, I have also used dual-task paradigms, revealing dissociations between central attention and auditory attention.

## *Learning and Transfer*

In a second line of research, I am studying the degree of transfer resulting from perceptual and associative learning. Specifically, I am interested in the structural properties of learning tasks that enable the acquisition of knowledge and skills, which generalize to new tasks and stimuli. For instance, in a study on rule-based category learning, we observed that transfer to new stimulus exemplars crucially depends on the training task, with category identification producing more transfer than category discrimination.

I am also interested in the effects of (1) extensive training with cognitively demanding tasks (e.g., task-switching or working-memory updating) and (2) more joyful activities such as playing video games. In both fields, I aim to identify the exact task mechanics, and the cognitive and perceptual demands, that may be responsible for the beneficial effects on attention and cognition, as well as (in case of certain types of video games) for the detrimental effects such as the occurrence of addictive behavior.

## *Evaluative Conditioning*

In the field of evaluative conditioning (i.e., affective-evaluative change resulting from stimulus pairings), I am most interested in (a) the dependency of evaluative conditioning on cognitive resources (e.g., attention, cognitive control) and (b) the effects of evaluative conditioning on sensory processing. In addition, I have been studying effects of statistical contingency between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli – and the resulting subjective judgments of contigency – on the evaluative change.

## *Psychophysics*

I am also interested in the evaluation and development of psychophysical methods. In the field of measurement theory, I have contributed to our understanding of direct scaling methods with sensory attributes that may not necessarily be represented on a linear scale (e.g. pitch perception). In addition, I have been working on psychometric fitting procedures to account for the ongoing change of underlying parameters (e.g., due to learning).
